# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please email [security@bl1nk.site](mailto:security@bl1nk.site) with details. We take security seriously and will respond as soon as possible.

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much information as possible, including:

* A description of the vulnerability and potential impact.
* Steps to reproduce the issue.
* Any logs or context that may help us identify the issue.

Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

## Supported Versions

We currently support the latest major release of the **BLinkOS Platform**. Only the main branch is actively maintained; older versions may not receive security updates.

## Security Best Practices

* Never commit secrets (API keys, passwords) to the repository. Use environment variables instead.
* Keep dependencies up to date by using tools like Dependabot.
* Enable two-factor authentication on your GitHub account.
* Use a supported, up‑to‑date version of Node.js.
